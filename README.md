# Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Mode 4 Communication Model for ns-3

A ns-3 model for C-V2X Mode 4 communication based on the ns-3 D2D model from [NIST](https://github.com/usnistgov/psc-ns3/tree/d2d-ns-3.22).

## Installation

1. Clone or download the source code from this repository
2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned/downloaded repository
3. Configure the project using the command
```
   ./waf configure
```
4. Build the project using the command
```
   ./waf build
```

For more details regarding the configuration and building of ns-3 projects see [the ns-3 documentation](https://www.nsnam.org/documentation/).

## Usage

A example script for the usage of the C-V2X Mode 4 is located in the *scratch* directory of this repository (*v2x_communication_example.cc*).
To run the example script run:
```
   ./waf --run v2x_communication_example
```

# Wenjian's Modification----Version 1
1.pf-ff-mac-scheduler.cc has one line that should be commented to avoid compiling error.

2.I have uploaded my code: v2x_platoon_communication in scratch folder.

3.I have met one problem in running my code.

This problem may result from vector size and I will try to fix it.

My next step is modifying this code and upload version 2.
